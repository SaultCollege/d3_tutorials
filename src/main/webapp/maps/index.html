            <q>D3’s core functionality doesn’t handle bitmap map tiles, such as those provided by Google Maps or Cloudmade. D3 is great with anything vector—SVG images or GeoJSON data—but wasn’t originally intended to work with traditional map tiles. (Bitmap images are made up of pixels, so resizing them larger or smaller is difficult without a loss in quality. Vector images are defined by points, lines, and curves—mathematical equations, really—and can be scaled up or down without a loss in quality.) This is starting to change, with the introduction of the <a href='https://github.com/d3/d3-plugins/tree/master/geo/tile'>d3.geo.tile plug-in</a>. Prior to this plug-in, geomapping with D3 meant either going all-SVG and avoiding tiles or using D3 to create SVG visuals on top of a base layer of map tiles (which would be managed by another library, like Leaflet or Polymaps—see the section “Alternatives” later in this chapter). This question of how to integrate bitmap tiles and vector graphics comes up a lot in the D3 community. As of today, there is no super-simple and perfect answer, but I think you can expect to see lots of work done in this area, and possibly the new tile-handling methods integrated into the D3 core at some point in the future.</q>
